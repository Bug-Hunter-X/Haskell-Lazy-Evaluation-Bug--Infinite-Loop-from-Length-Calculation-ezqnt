The following Haskell code attempts to perform a lazy evaluation but results in an unexpected infinite loop due to an improper use of `seq`:

```haskell
import Data.Char

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = map toUpper ['a'..'z']
  let ys = map toLower xs
  print (length ys)
  print (head ys)

```

The issue is that even though `xs` is generated lazily, the call to `length ys` forces the entire list `ys` to be evaluated, which then tries to evaluate `xs` completely to create `ys`. This creates an infinite loop because the `toUpper` operation, combined with the forced evaluation, creates a circular dependency.  The use of `seq` is not correctly placed to prevent this.
